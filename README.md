# 3D-MD-of-coarse-grained-hard-sphere
Code for running 2D/3D hard spheres using velocity scaling approach for controlling temperature. The 
potential used in the current model example is core-softened potential but it can be easily changed by
changing the potential function. 
mdinp.inp: Input files containing parameters for running the system
md_dw.f: Code which need mdinp.inp as an input file.
